# Chest-X-ray-Image-Classification-using-Decision-Tree-model
The dataset contains Chest X-ray images classified as Covid-19, Normal and Pneumonia. 
The first step is to extract features from the images using VGG16 - a pre-trained CNN and then train decision tree model. I have used GridSearchCV in order to identify the best value for the hyper-parameter, max_leaf_nodes.
